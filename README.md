# Java OOP Project

This is a **simple project** created for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course** in Java at university, using Visual Studio Code as the development environment. The project demonstrates basic OOP concepts in Java and organizes the code in a clear structure.

## Getting Started

Welcome! This project uses VS Code and the Java extensions to illustrate a sample OOP implementation in Java. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two main folders:

- `src`: the folder that holds your Java source files (classes).
- `lib`: the folder that can hold any external dependencies.

The compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open the `.vscode/settings.json` file and update the relevant settings there.

## Dependency Management

The **JAVA PROJECTS** view in VS Code allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found in the [official documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## How to Run

1. **Open the Project**: Launch Visual Studio Code and open the project folder.
2. **Locate the Main Class**: Open the Java file that contains the `main` method (typically `Main.java`).
3. **Run the Application**:
   - Click the **Run** button (the green triangle) at the top of the editor, or
   - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and type `Java: Run Java`.
4. **View the Output**: The applicationâ€™s output will appear in the Debug Console or Terminal.

This project is **just a simple example** for the **OOP in Java** course!
